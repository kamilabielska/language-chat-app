# language chat app
Reasons for creating this app were threefold:
1. I wanted to play and create a web app with React and flask
2. I wanted to try using ChatGPT api
3. I wanted to display the errors I make while conversing with ChatGPT in Italian in a visual manner (so that I don't have to compare the two texts word by word)

So maybe the reason was onefold: *I wanted to*.

# running the app
You need to have NodeJS installed. Create a virtual environment (called venv) in the `backend` folder and install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.

Then cd to the app folder and run  
`npm run start-backend`  
to start the Flask backend. After that, tun
`npm start`  
to run React frontend.
